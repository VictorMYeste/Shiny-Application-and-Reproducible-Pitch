## Do you want to live in Spain?

There are only 6 cities with more than half a million of people in Spain. So if you want to live in a big city... not much of a choice.

1. Madrid
2. Barcelona
3. Valencia
4. Sevilla
5. Zaragoza
6. Málaga.

Six cities for your next home. Which one to choose?

## Database of cities

The database have the following data:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cities <- data.frame(name = c("Madrid", "Barcelona", "Valencia",
              "Sevilla", "Zaragoza", "Málaga"),
        pop = c(3334730, 1664182, 800215, 691395, 681877, 578460),
        area = c(604.45, 101.35, 134.65, 140.8, 973.78, 398.25),
        col = c("> 1 million pop", "> 1 million pop",
             "> 750 thousand pop", "> 500 thousand pop",
             "> 500 thousand pop", "> 500 thousand pop"))
cities
```

## Use the APP... and choose wisely

Just select the minimum of population and area that you would like your city to have... and the app will show you a plot with how many comply with your selection. And even a list of the cities you can choose.
